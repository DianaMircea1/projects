# Tourism Audit Frontend - Active Development Context

## Current Work Focus:
*   **Primary Focus:** Setting up the foundation for the Tourism Audit Frontend application
*   **Immediate Objective:** Create a Next.js application that interfaces with the existing Python Flask backend
*   **Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Project Setup & Infrastructure
*   **Active Task:** Completing documentation and preparing for component library implementation
*   **Integration Goal:** Seamlessly connect frontend with the two-phase AI audit system (raw audit generation + Romanian template formatting)

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
*   **Form Strategy:** Deciding between single-page form vs multi-step wizard for audit requests
    - Consideration: User experience vs data collection completeness
    - Current direction: Multi-step form for better UX and reduced abandonment
*   **State Management:** Evaluating need for external state management vs React built-in state
    - Consideration: Application complexity vs dependency overhead
    - Current direction: Start with React hooks and Context, add Redux/Zustand if needed
*   **API Error Handling:** Designing comprehensive error handling strategy
    - Consideration: User experience during API failures vs technical accuracy
    - Current direction: Graceful degradation with clear user messaging
*   **Romanian Localization:** Determining approach for content management
    - Consideration: Hard-coded Romanian content vs i18n framework for future expansion
    - Current direction: Start with hard-coded content, structure for future i18n
*   **Authentication Requirements:** Clarifying if user accounts are needed
    - Consideration: Anonymous audit requests vs user tracking and history
    - Current direction: Start with anonymous requests, prepare for future authentication

## Recent Changes:
*   **Documentation Complete:** Finished architecture and technical specification documents
*   **Project Structure Analysis:** Reviewed existing Next.js 15 setup with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend Integration Planning:** Analyzed existing Python Flask backend structure and API requirements
*   **Task Planning:** Created comprehensive task backlog with priorities and dependencies
*   **Technology Stack Validation:** Confirmed Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + Radix UI approach

## Next Steps:
1. **Immediate (Next 1-2 Days):**
   - Set up shadcn/ui component library properly
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for backend API communication
   - Implement basic page structure with Next.js App Router
   - Design and code the main layout components (Header, Footer, Navigation)

2. **Short Term (Next Week):**
   - Build audit request form with proper validation
   - Implement API service layer for backend communication
   - Create basic UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
   - Set up error handling and loading states

3. **Medium Term (Next 2-3 Weeks):**
   - Integrate with backend API for audit requests
   - Implement audit results display components
   - Add Romanian localization and content
   - Set up SEO optimization and meta tags

4. **Preparation for Backend Integration:**
   - Define exact API endpoints and data contracts
   - Implement proper error handling for API failures
   - Create mock API responses for development
   - Set up environment variables for different deployment stages

## Technical Context:
*   **Backend System:** Two-phase AI audit system with OpenAI integration
*   **Backend Components:** DigitalAuditor (Phase 1) ‚Üí TemplateProcessor (Phase 2) ‚Üí EmailService (Phase 3)
*   **Data Flow:** Frontend form ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí AI processing ‚Üí Email delivery ‚Üí Results display
*   **Integration Points:** 
    - Property data submission endpoint
    - Audit status polling endpoint  
    - Results retrieval endpoint
*   **Romanian Template:** Must match the "AUDIT DIGITAL ‚Äì [NUME]" format with status icons (‚úÖ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ùå)

## Development Environment Status:
*   **Next.js 15.4.5:** ‚úÖ Configured and running
*   **TypeScript:** ‚úÖ Enabled with strict mode
*   **Tailwind CSS 4:** ‚úÖ Configured
*   **Radix UI:** ‚úÖ Dependencies installed
*   **shadcn/ui:** üîÑ Configuration exists, needs component generation
*   **ESLint:** ‚úÖ Configured
*   **Vercel Deployment:** ‚ùå Not yet configured

## Outstanding Questions:
*   **API Authentication:** Does the backend require API keys or authentication tokens?
*   **Rate Limiting:** What are the rate limits for audit requests?
*   **File Uploads:** Will the frontend need to handle any file uploads (images, documents)?
*   **Real-time Updates:** Should audit progress be shown in real-time or via polling?
*   **Error Recovery:** How should the frontend handle partial failures in the two-phase system?

---

**Current Priority:** Complete the foundation setup and move to Phase 2 (Core Components & UI) to start building the user interface that will integrate with the existing backend audit system.
